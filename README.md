This project took inspiration from the following repository: https://github.com/nlieb/PyTron.
We used a similar file organization structure and iterated upon their pygame logic for creating the game and
interactable UI.

Overall, we used their repository to learn how to interact with pygame and utilized one of their algorithms for partially training
the Genetic and DeepQ models.
